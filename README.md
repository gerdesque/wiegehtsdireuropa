## About [_Wie geht's dir, Europa?_](https://gerdesque.github.io/wiegehtsdireuropa/)

The web project **"Wie geht´s dir, Europa?"** (How are you, Europe?) has been created  
as a prototype during the cultural hackathon Coding da Vinci Süd from April to May 2019. 

In occasion of the elections for the parliament of the EU in 2019 the project combines  
photographs from the professional photographer Willy Pragher (1908-1992),  
who captured the 1920s to 1940s in a highly aesthetic perspective,  
and Twitter tweets from 2019 as collected statements about the European Union and Europe.  

What emerges half automatically are positive and negative,  
sometimes even funny and surprising memes on the topic of Europe and the EU.

_The photographs before had been digitized  
by the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg (State archive of Baden-Wuerttemberg)  
and made accessable by the online regional information system LEO-BW.  
The photos were made available under a CC-BY license, the associated metadata under a CC0-license._
